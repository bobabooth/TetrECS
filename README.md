# TetrECS

## Introduction
TetrECS is an adaptation of the popular puzzle video game Tetris. The game mechanics are similar, with the key difference being the pieces do not drop down from above but instead remain static and can be placed anywhere on the board. A timer is implemented so that a life would be deducted if no pieces are placed when the countdown ends.
