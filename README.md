# TetrECS

## Introduction
TetrECS is inspired by the popular puzzle video game Tetris. The game mechanics between the two are similar, with the key difference being that unlike Tetris, the pieces do not descend onto the playing field but instead can be placed anywhere on the board. A countdown is implemented so that a life would be deducted if no pieces are placed within the time frame.
